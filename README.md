# Bifrost
Bifrost allows Clockwork games to offer HoloLens Mixed Reality experiences
It has two separate components:

    - Asgard: The Clockwork Holographic Client, it is a Holographic UWP app that mimics the behavior of Spritesheet.js in Mixed Reality
    - Heimdall: A rendering library for Clockwork that connects to the Clockwork Holographic Client and sends the relevant data

As of today, a PC running Clockwork is necessary to play games. This technology is intended as a bridge (hence the name) that provides a first approximation, and serves as the base for an eventual holographic version of the Clockwork Runtime.
